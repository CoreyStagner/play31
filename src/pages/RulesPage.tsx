      <h1>How To Play 31</h1>
        <p>
            You start play 31 by either grabbing the top face up card on the discard
            pile, or by grabbing the card on the top of the face down draw pile. You
            will see how that card works with the other cards in your hand. You will
            then discard one card from your hand and that card becomes the new top
            card on the discard pile.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must grab a card from either pile and place one down each turn, but
            you can not grab the top of the discard pile just to place it back down
            on top of the discard pile. So in the case mentioned here you would just
            grab the top of the draw pile and place it directly on top of the
            discard pile.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you feel that you have a good hand, at the beginning of your turn before you draw, you may "knock" where you will knock on the table or verbally say "knock" to let the other players know. This action signifies the last round of the game. Your turn is forfeited and you must not draw a card. Each of the remaining players have one more opportunity to improve thier hand. Once each of the other players do one more draw action, and a "31" is not achieved, each player will lay down their hands revealing all three cards, and the person with the lowest suited score will pay one chip.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are multiple people that all have the same score, each player with the lowest score will play.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the person who "knocked" is the lowest score that person will pay two chips.
        </p>
      <h2>Goal of 31</h2>
        <p>
            31 is a game where you want to be the last person standing in the game
            with Chips remaining in your stack.
        </p>
      <h2>How to get "31"</h2>
        <p>
            In order to get "31" you must have 3 suited cards that contain two face
            cards and the ace of that suit. As soon as you get "31", you will call
            out "Thirty One" and lay down your hand face up so that they table can
            see. If it is verified then everyone at the game table, except for the
            person who acheived "31", will pay one chip to be set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
            If two people have 31 at the same time, it will be who ever said it
            first will be the one who achieved "31". So as soon as you get the "31"
            it is advantagous to call it out immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only exception to this rule would be if two people were dealt "31",
            both players would be considered as the players who acheived "31"
            meaning that both players would not have to pay, but other players
            remaining in the game would.
        </p>
      <h2>How to start the Game</h2>
        <p>
            You will start the game with 4 physical chips and 1 "Grace Chip",
            ultimately giving each player 5 chips to begin with. Once the 4 physical
            chips all run out, you will have one last chance to survive in the game
            called "Grace". When you are on grace if you lose another round, you
            will be out of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are also able to use 5 physical chips with no "Grace Chip", and the
            rules would remain the same but rather than having to remember if you
            are on grace or not. You would play until you have no chips remaining.
        </p>
      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
            You may not touch another players chips at any time during the game.
            If you do you will be charged a one chip penalty.
            </li>
            <li>
            If you make a mistake that affects the game, it will be up to the game
            commissioner for handling the next action or penalty.
            </li>
            <li>
            If you hold up the game for an excessive amount of time, the game
            commissioner is responsible for handling the next action or penalty
            </li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Special Rules</h2>
        <p>These rules are optional but make the game more interesting.</p>
        <p>
            If you have three of the same face value, they would be three different
            suits, that is treated as a score of knocking.
        </p>
